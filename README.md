# AIWorldNext â€” Ready Repo (Sample)

This repository is a ready-to-upload Next.js project pre-filled with realistic sample JSON content (100+ entries)
across News, Blogs, Jobs, Products, Resources, Startups, Robotics, Community, Podcasts, Websites, Partnerships and Vision.

## Notes
- Content files live in `/content/*.json` (structured JSON).
- Pages import these JSON files and render simple cards (dark theme/Tailwind-ready).
- `next.config.js` uses `output: 'export'` so Netlify static export works.
- Images are Unsplash-style placeholder links inside JSON (no local large images to keep repo size small).
- After uploading to GitHub, connect to Netlify with build command `npm run build` and publish directory `out`.
